## panCancer Networks
The goal of this project is to build proteomic-derived networks across data from the PDC using a community detection based approach on multigraphs to build hyphal networks - networks that share inforamtion across individual patient-derived 'trees'. This analysis works across a number of different scripts

### Download data (TBD)
We are currently working on implementing a script that queries the PDC for all necessary data

### Build the panCancer hyphal network


### Build individual cancer networks

### Compare existing networks to genetic mutations, clinical phenotypes
